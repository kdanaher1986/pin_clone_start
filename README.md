# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

If you don't have the latest version already, be sure to have the latest version of Ruby 2.4.1. You can install this by going to rubygems.org and search for this or latest versions, or install through your terminal

```
brew install ruby
```

* System dependencies
All gems necessary for this app to function are included in the gemfile, only one of them needs to be installed in the computer and for this app to recognize HAML code in rails 5. 
```
gem 'haml-rails', '~> 1.0'
```
You can copy and paste this code into the terminal

```
gem install haml-rails
```

After install is complete, restart the server and HAML will work perfectly :D.
